# Code Style

## 1.Tools-based Assistance

- You need to use [gdtoolkit](https://github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit) and rustfmt to format the code.You can copy ```script/pre-commit``` to ```.git/hooks``` to do that automatically

## 2.Naming Conventions

- For the names of all nodes, we stipulate the use of PascalCase format.
